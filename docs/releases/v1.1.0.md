# GPM v1.1.0

Welcome to the release of Gatekeeper Policy Manager version 1.1.0 ðŸŽ‰

This is a minor release including user experience improvements, new features and dependencies maintenance:

- [[#1327]](https://github.com/sighupio/gatekeeper-policy-manager/pull/1327) UX improvements:
  - Allow sorting, searching and filtering in the constraints violations table.
  - Make the navigation bar for Constraints and Constraints Templates sticky, so it will scroll with the view.
  - Clicking a link now scrolls to the top of the item instead of the middle.
  - Active item indicator seems to be working properly.
  - Disabled text truncating in the Constraints nav bar, is not great but better that not seeing the whole name.
  - Rebranding: Kubernetes Fury Distribution to SIGHUP Distribution
- Bumped all JavaScript and Python dependencies to their latest compatible version.
