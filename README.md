**Gatekeeper Policy Manager** is a simple *read-only* web UI for viewing OPA Gatekeeper policies' status in a Kubernetes Cluster.

The target Kubernetes Cluster can be the same where GPM is running or some other [remote cluster(s) using a `kubeconfig` file](#Multi-cluster-support). You can also run GPM [locally in a client machine](#Running-locally) and connect to a remote cluster.

GPM can display all the defined **Constraint Templates** with their rego code, all the Gatekeeper Configuration CRDs, and all the **Constraints** with its current status, violations, enforcement action, matches definitions, etc.

[You can see some screenshots below](#Screenshots).

## Requirements

You'll need OPA Gatekeeper running in your cluster and at least some constraint templates and constraints defined to take advantage of this tool.

ℹ You can easily deploy Gatekeeper to your cluster using the (also open source) [Fury Kubernetes OPA](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-opa) module.

## Deploying GPM

### Deploy using Kustomize

To deploy Gatekeeper Policy Manager to your cluster, apply the provided [`kustomization`](kustomization.yaml) file running the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -k .
```

By default, this will create a deployment and a service both with the name `gatekeper-policy-manager` in the `gatekeeper-system` namespace. We invite you to take a look into the `kustomization.yaml` file to do further configuration.

> The app can be run as a POD in a Kubernetes cluster or locally with a `kubeconfig` file. It will try its best to autodetect the correct configuration.

Once you've deployed the application, if you haven't set up an ingress, you can access the web-UI using port-forward:

```bash
kubectl -n gatekeeper-system port-forward  svc/gatekeeper-policy-manager 8080:80
```

Then access it with your browser on: [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

### Deploy using Helm

It is also possible to deploy GPM using the [provided Helm Chart](./chart).

First create a values file, for example `my-values.yaml`, with your custom values for the release. See the [chart's readme](./chart/README.md) and the [default values.yaml](./chart/values.yaml) for more information.

Then, execute:

```bash
helm repo add gpm https://sighupio.github.io/gatekeeper-policy-manager
helm upgrade --install --namespace gatekeeper-system --set image.tag=v0.5.2-rc17 --values my-values.yaml gatekeeper-policy-managergpm/gatekeeper-policy-manager
```

## Running locally

GPM can also be run locally using docker and a `kubeconfig`, assuming that the `kubeconfig` file you want to use is located at `~/.kube/config` the command to run GPM locally would be:

```bash
docker run -v ~/.kube/config:/home/gpm/.kube/config -p 8080:8080 quay.io/sighup/gatekeeper-policy-manager:v0.5.2-rc17
```

Then access it with your browser on: [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

> You can also run the flask app directly, see the [development section](#Development) for further information.

## Configuration

GPM is a stateless application, but it can be configured using environment variables. The possible configurations are:

| Env Var Name                      | Description                                                                                                       | Default                |

> ⚠️ Please notice that OIDC Authentication is in beta state. It has been tested to work with Keycloak as a provider.
>
> These environment variables are already provided and ready to be set in the [`manifests/enable-oidc.yaml`](manifests/enable-oidc.yaml) file.

### Multi-cluster support

Since `v0.5.2-rc17` GPM has basic multi-cluster support when using a `kubeconfig` with more than one context. GPM will let you chose the context right from the UI.

If you want to run GPM in a cluster but with multi-cluster support, it's as easy as mounting a `kubeconfig` file in GPM's pod(s) with the cluster access configuration and set the environment variable `KUBECONFIG` with the path to the mounted `kubeconfig` file. Or you can simply mount it in `/home/gpm/.kube/config` and GPM will detect it automatically.

> Please remember that the user for the clusters should have the right permissions. You can use the [`manifests/rabc.yaml`](manifests/rbac.yaml) file as reference.
>
> Also note that the cluster where GPM is running should be able to reach the other clusters.

When you run GPM locally, you are already using a `kubeconfig` file  to connect to the clusters, now you should see all your defined contexts and you can switch between them easily from the UI.

## Development

GPM is written in Python using the Flask framework for the backend and Fomantic-UI for the frontend. To develop GPM, you'll need to create a Python 3 virtual environment, install all the dependencies specified in the provided `requirements.txt` and you are good to start hacking.

The following commands should get you up and running:

```bash
# Download fronted dependencies with NPM
$ pushd app/static
$ npm install
$ popd
# Create a virtualenv
$ python3 -m venv env
# Activate it
$ source ./env/bin/activate
# Install all the dependencies
$ pip install -r app/requirements-dev.txt
# Run the development server
$ FLASK_APP=app/app.py flask run
```

> Access to a Kubernetes cluster with Gatekeeper deployed is recommended to debug the application.
>
> You'll need an OIDC provider to test the OIDC authentication. You can use our [fury-kubernetes-keycloak](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-keycloak) module.

## Roadmap

The following is a wishlist of features that we would like to add to GPM (in no particular order):

- [x] List the constraints that are currently using a `ConstraintTemplate`
- [ ] Polished OIDC authentication
- [ ] LDAP authentication
- [x] Better syntax highlighting for the rego code snippets
- [x] Root-less docker image
- [x] Multi-cluster view
- [ ] Minimal write capabilities?
- [ ] Rewrite app in Golang?

Please, let us know if you are using GPM and what features would you like to have by creating an issue here on GitHub 💪🏻
